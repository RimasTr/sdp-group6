This folder contains the bluetooth classes which are used to control the robot remotely.
In order to test the bluetooth (via running the 'TestBluetooth.java' class) you must first
ensure the brick has the 'Roboto.nxj' program uploaded to it. For instructions to do this
see the README in the 'balle.bluetooth' folder.
Run the 'Roboto' program on the brick, it will show it is looking for a connection.
Now run the 'TestBluetooth.java' class. This will connect to the brick and the user can now
control the robot via the keyboard, e.g. W for forward, Q for stop etc...
