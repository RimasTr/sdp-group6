All the code in the balle.brick.* folders is for the NXT brick.

This code is compiled via the command-line using NXJ.
The 'compile-robot.sh' script in the '/src' folder does this automatically.
Once compiled, the '.nxj' files have to be uploaded to the brick.
This can be done via bluetooth using either the 'nxjupload filename.nxj' or 'nxjbrowse -b'.

E.g. 
$ cd /path/to/eclipse/sdp-group6
$ cd src
$ ./compile-robot.sh
$ nxjbrowse -b OR $ nxjupload filename.nxj
