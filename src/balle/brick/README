All the code in the balle.brick.* folders is for the NXT brick.

This code is compiled via the command-line using NXJ.
The 'compile-robot.sh' script in the '/src' folder does this automatically.
Remember to run '. ./nxj.sh' in the 'sdp-group6-folder' before this, otherwise
the NXJ libraries will not be linked and the code can't compile.
Once compiled, the '.nxj' files have to be uploaded to the brick.
This can be done via bluetooth using either the 'nxjupload filename.nxj' or 'nxjbrowse -b'.

E.g. 
$ cd /path/to/eclipse/sdp-group6
$ . ./nxj.sh
$ cd src
$ ./compile-robot.sh
$ nxjbrowse -b OR $ nxjupload filename.nxj
